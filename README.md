# VueTodo V1 (PhoneGap)
Tried to port my Vue app to PhoneGap. Ended up as an unpleasant experience. Worked in the PhoneGap Developer app but did not work in development.

## What's Next?
When I started learning React Native, Expo was recommended in the official docs so I went with it.   
After months of development, bored of its limitations, I finally decided to drop it and go with React Native CLI.   
With React Native CLI, hot reload worked at least 500% faster, and I could use any library I wanted.   
It is just an uneccessary layer at the top of React Native that only slow downs and limits the development.   
It may be the case here too, React Native being the Cordova and Expo being the PhoneGap I have problems with.   
I've already seen other developers' saying to go with plain Cordova and not PhoneGap, because they have a lot of issues with it, e.g. hard debugging. Just look at some of the honest reviews of the PhoneGap development app.   
   
So yeah, tomorrow I will try to do the same, but without the PhoneGap layer, just Cordova. Then we'll see, but I also want to check out the [Framework7](https://framework7.io/) which looks very promising and it's performance is pretty smooth on my mid-tier Android device.
